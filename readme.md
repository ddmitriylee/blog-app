# Blog CRUD application

### This is my CRUD Blog application which I built using Node JS, Express, MongoDB and EJS.

### Note: the application won't work until you start the MongoDB.

- First things first, you must install the packages, I'll leave the package.json and package-lock.json files in the git, so you can just type this command:

```
npm install
```

- Then, you need to start the MongoDB. I do it by typing this command in my terminal:

```
brew services start mongodb-community@6.0
```

- After that, our app is ready to be started:

```
npm start
```

### The application supports all the CRUD operations.
